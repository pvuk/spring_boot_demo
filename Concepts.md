##URI and URL
The difference between them is straightforward after knowing their definitions:

Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) − a sequence of characters that allows the complete identification of any abstract or physical resource
Uniform Resource Locator (URL) − a subset of URI that, in addition to identifying where a resource is available, describes the primary mechanism to access it

Every URL has to start with any of these schemes: ftp, http, https, gopher, mailto, news, nntp, telnet, wais, file, or prospero. If it doesn't start with it, then it's not a URL.


Now that we know the syntax, let's look at some examples. Here is a list of URIs, where only the first three are URLs:

`ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1808.txt`

`https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986`

`mailto:john@doe.com`
 
`tel:+1-816-555-1212`

`urn:oasis:names:docbook:dtd:xml:4.1`

`urn:isbn:1234567890`
